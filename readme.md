Absolutely! I can prepare a **step-by-step, file-by-file documentation** for your hackathon IoT + ML + RPA project, **without including code**, focusing on **what each part does, how it interacts, and the overall workflow**. Here’s a complete documentation draft you can include as `PROJECT_DOC.md` or submit as a report.

# IoT + ML + RPA Hackathon Project Documentation

## Project Overview

This project is a **simulated IoT system** integrated with **ML anomaly detection** and **RPA automation**, enhanced with **GPT-OSS reasoning** for interpretability.

The system architecture is:

**Sensors (simulated) → API → DB → ML Detector → GPT-OSS Reasoner → RPA Engine → Devices / Logs / Dashboard**

* **Sensors**: Send periodic or triggered data to the API.
* **API**: Receives sensor events, stores them, triggers ML and GPT-OSS reasoning.
* **DB**: Stores events, anomalies, ML scores, GPT explanations, and executed actions.
* **ML Detector**: Detects anomalies using an IsolationForest-based model.
* **GPT-OSS Reasoner**: Provides human-readable explanations for anomalies and suggested actions.
* **RPA Engine**: Performs automated actions based on anomalies, such as toggling devices or running safe scripts.
* **Dashboard**: Web interface to monitor devices and events.

* **Purpose**: ML anomaly detection and GPT reasoning.

  * `trainer.py`: Creates a sample IsolationForest model for anomaly detection.
  * `detector.py`: Loads model and predicts if a sensor value is anomalous.
  * `gpt_oss_adapter.py`: Generates reasoning text for anomalies (mocked by default, optional GPT-OSS integration).

#### `rpa/`

  * `static/app.js`: Placeholder for future JS dashboard logic.

### `src/sensors/`

* **Purpose**: Simulate sensor data for testing.

  * `simulator.py`: Sends temperature or motion sensor events to API periodically.

### `src/tests/`

* **Purpose**: Unit and integration tests.

  * **Unit Tests**:

    * `test_detector.py`: Verifies ML anomaly detection works.
    * `test_gpt_adapter.py`: Checks GPT reasoning (mocked) returns expected format.
  * **Integration Tests**:

    * `test_integration.py`: Simulates full workflow:

      * Submit sensor event → detect anomaly → GPT reasoning → schedule RPA → verify device state.

## 2. Step-by-Step Data Flow

1. **Sensor Event Submission**

   * Sensor (or simulator) sends JSON payload to `POST /sensor`.
   * Example: `{"sensor_id": "temp-1", "type": "temperature", "value": 45.0}`

2. **API Processing**

   * Stores event in DB (initially `is_anomaly=False`).
   * Calls ML detector to check for anomalies.
   * Calls GPT adapter for reasoning/explanation.
   * Decides RPA action based on anomaly type.
   * Schedules RPA execution in the background.

3. **ML Detector**

   * Uses IsolationForest model to compute anomaly score.
   * Returns `is_anomaly` flag and numeric score.

4. **GPT-OSS Adapter**

   * Returns human-readable explanation for detected anomaly.
   * By default, uses **mocked reasoning** (deterministic text) for CPU-friendly environments.
   * Optional GPT-OSS integration provides richer reasoning.

5. **RPA Engine**

   * Executes safe actions:

     * Toggle device state in `devices.json`.
     * Run scripts in `scripts/` directory.
   * Logs all actions.

6. **Dashboard & Events**

   * `GET /events` returns recent events with ML score, GPT explanation, and RPA action.
   * `GET /devices` returns device states.
   * Frontend updates every 5 seconds to reflect real-time status.

---

## 3. GPT-OSS Integration

* **Location**: `ml/gpt_oss_adapter.py`
* **Purpose**: Provide interpretable reasoning for anomalies.
* **Default**: Mocked explanation (deterministic).
* **Optional**: Use `USE_GPT_OSS=true` with local GPT-OSS model to generate natural-language explanations.
* **Usage**: Keeps humans in the loop for automated RPA decisions.

---

## 4. RPA Engine Safety

* **Only executes scripts in `scripts/`**.
* Uses path checks to prevent malicious paths.
* Recommended additional production safety:

  * Run scripts as unprivileged user.
  * Validate arguments.
  * Rate-limit actions.

---

## 5. Security Considerations

* No network calls from RPA by default.
* DB and device files are local; no remote access.
* GPT-OSS output **never executed as shell code**.
* ML model is synthetic for demo; replace with production data for realistic deployments.

---

## 6. Limitations

* IsolationForest model is synthetic; not trained on real sensor data.
* GPT-OSS models require large memory and GPU for local inference.
* Current dashboard is basic HTML; not optimized for production monitoring.
* RPA actions are limited to file toggles and safe scripts.

---

## 7. Suggested Hackathon Extensions

1. Integrate **real home automation devices** using MQTT or Home Assistant APIs.
2. Use GPT reasoning for **multi-step automated planning**.
3. Deploy **small quantized LLMs** for low-resource environments.
4. Create **interactive React dashboard** with live charts.
5. Implement **RBAC, authentication, and audit logs** for RPA actions.

---

## 8. Running the Project

1. **Environment**

   * Use Python 3.11, install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
   * Optional: GPU + local GPT-OSS model.

2. **Start API**

   * `uvicorn src.app.main:app --reload`
   * Dashboard available at `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Run Sensor Simulator**

   * Send mock events with `python src/sensors/simulator.py --count 10 --type temperature`

4. **Check Events & Devices**

   * `GET /events` → list recent events.
   * `GET /devices` → current device states.

5. **Optional GPT-OSS**

   * Set `USE_GPT_OSS=true` and configure `MODEL_DIR` to local model path.

---

## 9. Testing

* **Unit Tests**: Verify ML detection and GPT reasoning.
* **Integration Tests**: Full sensor → ML → GPT → RPA → device flow.
* Use `pytest` to run tests:

  ```bash
  pytest src/tests/
  ```

---

## 10. Key Takeaways

* Fully functional demo of IoT + ML + RPA with reasoning.
* Safe and CPU-friendly by default (mock GPT-OSS).
* Modular design allows easy extension to real devices and full LLM reasoning.
* Provides a clear **hackathon-ready workflow** and demo pipeline.

If you want, I can also **prepare a one-page visual architecture diagram** showing **data flow from sensors to RPA and dashboard**, which is excellent for hackathon documentation and presentations.

Do you want me to create that diagram as well?
